# FAKENEWS-DETECTION
Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning.
Research Questions
Due to the vigorous nature of this study, there are many parameters to consider which leads to some pressing questions. Some of these questions are.
1. How does the size of the dataset to be trained affect the performance of the machine-learning model?
2. What are the key features that distinguish fake news from real news and how can these features be incorporated into machine learning models?
3. How can the machine learning models be generated with high accuracy score?
4. How can these models be utilized to flag fake news in real world setting and the authenticity of the news?
5. Can these machine-learning models be extended to web page for detection?
